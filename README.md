# Word Wars

## Abstract

I was given a choice on what to do for my final project of module 3 at Turing School of Software & Design.
We had 5 days to develop an app using React. Word Wars is a dictionary definition multiple choice game. I am using the merriam-webster elementary dictionary API along with a random word generator to create questions. The user is able to play 10 question games and will see their results afterwards. The user has to sign in to the app to play and by doing this, it allows them to view their overall stats. I hope to restyle the app completely during the module intermission because the current layout is not my favorite.


## Specific Objectives

1. The user needs to be able to work with or manipulate the data.
2. The application should be a multi-page application using React Router.
3. The use of at least one external API.
4. Use a modular architecture for application file structure.
5. Write tests for React components (Integration and Unit)

## Installation

> Clone down this repo into an empty directory on your local machine
> Run `npm install` in your teminal to install the project's dependencies
> Run `npm start` to run the application in development mode
> Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser
> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Challenges

The main challenge of this project for me was testing asynchronously. Mocking out data for tests seemed rather useless previous to building this app, but it definitely saved me more than a couple times. I also struggled with getting the definitions to display in random order so they are not always in the same spot for every question. I think I dealt with these challenges is a decent way but refactoring is definitely on the agenda.

## Looking Ahead

After completing the MVP for this project and looking at it now, I would love to add more sad paths to the testing suites and also some more error handling to display error compoenents when something does work right. I feel I have a good grasp on React and asynchronous JavaScript but there is always room to grow.
